Program I wrote as part of my final project for my BioInformatics Class<br><br>
Input: location (integer) of target base pair on human chromosome 11<br>
Output: locations of 2 'cripr cuts' that would allow shortest amount of DNA to be spliced.<br><br>
It also returns a graphic of the resulting strands and cuts as well as the gRNA sequences need to make those cuts
